# Introduction
This project aims to forecast gold prices using various time series models and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can aid in decision-making processes for stakeholders.

# Data Collection
The collected data underwent several preprocessing steps including:
 * Handling missing values and outliers
 * Feature engineering (e.g., moving averages)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in the data using visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Predictive Modeling
The following predictive models were used to forecast gold prices:
  * Linear Regression
  * XGBoost Regressor
  * FB Prophet
  * ARIMA

# Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using cross-validation and performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance.

# Model Deployment
The final model was dockerized and deployed on AWS EC2 instances to ensure scalability and efficient access. Deployment involved:
  * Dockerization of the model
  * Deployment on EC2 instances

# Conclusion and Recommendations
Conclusions and suggestions derived from model evaluation were presented to stakeholders, ensuring practical applicability for decision-making processes.
